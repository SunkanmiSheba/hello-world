Learning how to create a new repository

Hello Humans!

Sunkanmi here, I am a beginner web developer who is enthusiastic about becoming a full-stack web developer.
I am currently a active member of the Hotels.ng internship program.
I am also learning to code with websites like Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp.
I am really excited about this journey.
